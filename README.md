# TMP-Notation-Engine
TMPNotationEngine is a lightweight Unity utility for TextMeshPro that converts plain-text math, science, and chemistry expressions into rich TMP formatting. Instead of manually writing &lt;sup>, &lt;sub>, and &lt;size> tags, developers can write x^2, x_1, H2O, or (a+b)/(c+d) and let the engine handle formatting.
